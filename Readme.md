Repository dedicated to study [*Effective Java, Third Edition*](https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Java-3rd-Joshua-Bloch/dp/0134685997).

## Intro

- Effective use of Java programming language
- Effective use of its libraries:
    - `java.lang`
    - `java.util`
    - `java.io`
    - `java.util.concurent`
    - `java.util.function`
- 90 items, a rule per item
- Accessible to anyone with a working knowledge, but still food for thought for advanced

Fundamental principles:
    - Clarity and simplicity
    - Users of a component should be never surprised about its behaviour
    - Components should be small (but not too small)
    - Dependencies kept to minimum
    - Code should be reused not copied
    - Errors should be detected as soon as possible (ideally at compile time)
